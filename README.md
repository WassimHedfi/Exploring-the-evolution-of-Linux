# Analyzing Evolution of a Linux
This project involves analyzing the evolution of a Linux kernel Git repository, a rich source of software project evolution data. Using version control repositories like CVS, Subversion, or Git, you'll work with real-world data to extract insights about the development activities spanning over 13 years. The dataset contains nearly 700k commits and contributions from numerous contributors.

By leveraging Pandas DataFrames, especially functions like read_csv and groupby, along with time series data handling, you'll clean, preprocess, and visualize the repository data. This project offers an opportunity to navigate data challenges while uncovering valuable information about the Linux kernel's developmental journey.
